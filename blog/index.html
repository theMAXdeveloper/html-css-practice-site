                    <p>Spears are the best tool known to man kind. As an advocate of daily spearing activities, I can say that a spear is truly worthy to be in the "pointy things" Hall of Fame. As a daily carry, a spear can help in self-defense efforts and open a can of soup in a hurry! Please consider this a notice to all non-spear-carryers: go out to your local walmart and buy a spear today! Its a cheap and cost effective way to improve your life over 13% more than your non-spearical neighbors. </p>
